                <p>
                    This is a post-event microsite for <a class="in-text-link" href="#">5X Fest</a>, a music festival that is driven by a profound commitment to elevate South Asian youth culture. Our proposed ideation is to create a microsite featuring an artist spotlight that allows us to stay true to their mission of supporting artists and creatives, while also working towards enhancing opportunities for South Asian artists and people of color in the arts and culture domain.

                <h2>Problem Statement and Research</h2> 
                <p>
                    North America’s essential South Asian youth culture festival, 5X Fest is a multi-day, multi-venue festival covering music, visual art, fashion, and culture hosted by the Vancouver International Bhangra Celebration Society. 

                </p>
                <p> 
                    Through extensive research, I observed that 5X Fest website lacks information about their featured artists in each music festival lineup and their representation of South Asian culture. Consequently, their current audience seems primarily limited to the South Asian community. To address this, our problem statement is: <span class="highlighted-points">“How can we effectively promote and expand the visibility of South Asian culture to a broader and more diverse audience?”</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Me and my team’s solution is through the microsite, as it will serve as a platform to showcase how each artist is linked to South Asian culture, incorporating modern elements to resonate with the young target audience.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project1-information-item">
                <h2>User Flow</h2> 
                    <img src="assets/img/project1/sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap of my website" class="project1-image">
                    <figcaption class="project1-figcaption">Sitemap of the microsite userflow</figcaption>

                        <p>
                            The microsite serves as a platform to showcase how each artist is linked to South Asian culture, by having an easy navigation through the different sections of the microsite. The flow begins with the main page that provides a brief explanation of the site's goals. The second section is the archive gallery of the post-event. Following that, users will discover individual artist pages, featuring diverse content ranging from discography to blog posts. Finally, there is the "Earlybird" section, where users can enter their email to receive notifications about the next festival.

                <h2>Art Direction</h2> 
                    <img src="assets/img/project1/art-direction.png" alt="Color palette and typography of my website" class="project1-image">
                    <figcaption class="project1-figcaption">Color palette and typography of my website</figcaption>
                    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was also in charge of the design research for the microsites, with considerations with how I could blend both South Asian culture and have a modern visual appeal to a broader audience. In the design approach, I found that neo-brutalism harmonizes well with the microsite, as it challenges the conventions of traditional color palettes by incorporating a range of bold colors reminiscent of South Asian designs. This aesthetic choice aims to better connect with youth culture, embracing progressivism and breaking away from traditional norms.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Typography</h3>
                        <p>
                            For the typography, I chose to design with the 'Syne' typeface. This is because the bold font has a sense of modernity, while the regular font maintains simplicity and adds a touch of fun. Notably, the distinct curl in the descender of the letter 'g' pays homage to most the South Asian writing system, further reinforcing the cultural connection. Additionally, I also selected the 'Jost' typeface for the navigation bar, as its simplicity complements the other design elements seamlessly.
                        </p>
            </div>
                
            <div class="project1-information-item">
                <h2>Coding</h2> 
                    <img src="assets/img/project1/coding.png" alt="Pinned post of an artist" class="project1-image">
                    <figcaption class="project1-figcaption">Pinned post of a featured artist</figcaption>
                    <h3>Column Property and Spacing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Within the design, I proposed that the artist page's aesthetic should have an engaging blend of social media and blog elements. Towards the bottom, an eye-catching collage of pictures resembling a blog post offers glimpses into the artist's daily life or significant moments, fostering a relatable connection with their audience. The technical aspect behind this is through using columns in CSS to layout my elements in the HTML files. I made a container to fill my elements, which are the heading, the pictures of the artists, the captions and other elements. In the CSS, I utilized ‘flex-direction: column’ property to make three columns in the collage. In each column, I use ‘display: block’ property to make 1 image in 1 line. 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used the ‘justify-content: space-between’ property to make equal spacing between each columns. For aligning the elements to not be too cluttered, I use margin and padding to make breathing room between the images and ensure that they are not located at the corner of the container.
                        </p>
            </div>
                
            <div class="project1-information-item">
                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <img src="assets/img/project1/prototype.gif" alt="Prototype of the website" class="project1-image">
                <figcaption class="project1-figcaption">Prototype of the website</figcaption>
                <p>
                    This is the final microsite design and userflow of the project. As users first enter the website, the first thing to see is the artist spotlight header and a CTA button that leads them back to the 5X homepage. Upon scrolling down, the microsite will introduce a small section about the purpose of the website by defining how it is ‘celebrating the artist talent’ as well as talk about 5X goals regarding South Asian culture. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second section is the gallery of the past event, where it is a carousel navigation and the user can click on the arrows to see next and previous images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the left, I ensure that the navigation bar remains sticky and accessible as users scroll through the content. Following our color scheme and art direction, each page exhibits a colour scheme and each colour of each bar blends through the background colour of the page its supposed to be on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The artist page's aesthetic is an engaging blend of social media and blog elements. Upon arrival, users receive a brief artist introduction, with easy-to-access social media platform buttons situated at the top right corner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As users scroll down on each artist’s page, they gain deeper insights into the artist's music, accompanied by Spotify popups where they can listen to song snippets. On the left side, two music recommendations (albums, singles, or EPs) lead to Spotify playlists for further exploration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Towards the bottom, an eye-catching collage of pictures resembling a blog post offers glimpses into the artist's daily life or significant moments, fostering a relatable connection with their audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the last section of the microsite, as the user reach the footer, they can see a CTA button that allows them to enter in their email for the earlybird access.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    This marks my initial experience into a UI project involving coding the final product, utilizing HTML and CSS for the first time. Tackling the layout to match our desired prototype and design proved to be the most challenging aspect of the coding process. Given the project's unconventional design, I delved into learning grids and flexbox to effectively organize elements. However, our main hurdle lies in responsiveness, particularly with the mobile version lacking visual appeal and experiencing overcrowding of elements. The layout of images necessitates extensive adjustments across breakpoints, an area where I lacked expertise in resolving. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, I would prioritize through planning before into coding and familiarize myself with advanced techniques for layout and responsiveness such as media queries or other responsive frameworks. This will help in devising a more efficient strategy and reduce the need for extensive adjustments later on. 
                </p>
