                        This project, titled "One Tap Away," is a collaborative effort involving myself and my teammates from Team Tech Along. Our team shares a collective passion for providing technological solutions for social services. "One Tap Away" comprises two components aimed at implementing a chatbot to support individuals affected by gender-based violence. Notably, this project was recognized as one of the winners of the 2023-24 SFU Student-Community Engagement Competition.                    </p>

                <p>
                    To bring the One Tap Away project to life, my team and I partnered closely with the Vancouver & Lower Mainland Multicultural Family Support Services Society (VLMFSS), an organization dedicated to aiding individuals affected by gender-based violence. Our collaboration involved regular weekly meetings with VLMFSS, during which I took responsibility for documenting notes and facilitating project reviews to track our progress effectively.

                <figcaption class="project2-figcaption">Data in my research shows the stats for the preference of Gen Z of online over in-person appointments</figcaption>

                <p> 
                    Drawing on insights from our project leader, Jae Eun, the concept for developing a technology intervention originated from her firsthand experience as a Victim Support Worker at VLMFSS. Through her observations, she noted a reluctance among young adults in their early 20s to seek assistance through traditional communication channels like phone calls or emails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through more research, I found out that this observation aligns with broader business trends. For instance, a 2023 Forbes article highlighted the preference of Millennials and Gen Z individuals for scheduling medical appointments via online platforms or mobile apps, reflecting a shift towards digital solutions for accessing services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So recognizing the young adults’ familiarity and preference toward online service delivery, the project rationale is, <span class="highlighted-points">‘How can we tailor resource provision methods for young students so that they can feel more comfortable in reaching out?'</span>

                <h3>Stage 1 — The Chatbot</h3>
                <p>
                    In response to the rationale of the project, there are two stages to the ‘One Tap Away’ Project. The first stage is to create the One Tap Away chatbot that is designed to deliver community resources on behalf of a human agent. My role in the team was to make sure the chatbot has good functionality as well as making sure the messages would provide a non-judgemental and easily accessible platform to get community resources. This is all considered when making the prototype. Since the young generations are familiar with social media or online systems in general, it transforms the daunting task of seeking help into an easier experience.

                <h3>Stage 2 — The Advisory Committtee</h3>
                <p>
                    Stage 2 of our project is forming the “Advisory Committee”, which is a collaborative design workshop, involving gender-based violence related stakeholders. Using VLMFSS’ existing partnerships with other organizations, such as post-secondary sexual violence support offices, me and my group plan to gather stakeholders and have regular collaborative workshops. This is a space where we can inform and revise the design and the content of the chatbot. 
                </p>

                <img src="assets/img/project2/logo.png" alt="Logo of Chatbot" class="project2-image" id="project2-logo-image">
                <figcaption class="project2-figcaption">Logo of One Tap Away Chatbot</figcaption>
                <p>
                    I took the lead in crafting the logo for our chatbot. Through numerous meetings, I gained a deep understanding of VLMFSS's vision and objectives. Their suggestion for the design was to evoke a sense of calmness and approachability, in line with the chatbot's goal of encouraging users to seek help.
                </p>      
                <p>
                    To achieve this, I opted for calming colors such as dark blue paired with pale yellow, mirroring the hues used in the VLMFSS logo. This choice aims to convey a sense of trustworthiness and reassurance to users interacting with the chatbot.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Additionally, I incorporated a symbolic element into the logo: a finger tapping on a button. This imagery reinforces our slogan, <span class="highlighted-points">"we are just one tap away"</span> emphasizing the ease and accessibility of reaching out for assistance.

                    <figcaption class="project2-figcaption">Prototype Demo of the One Tap Away Chatbot</figcaption>
                    <p>
                        This is a demonstration of the chatbot prototype we developed using a chatbot builder website. The prototype showcases its functionality by offering users multiple options to access resources tailored to their needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the user interact with the chatbot, they will notice it presents various options, allowing users to select resources that align with their circumstances. Upon selecting an option, the chatbot responds by providing a list of relevant links to resources, empowering users to make informed choices.Users can simply tap on the provided links to navigate to the corresponding websites, facilitating seamless access to valuable resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through this demonstration, it becomes evident how the chatbot serves as a valuable tool in not only providing but also raising awareness of community resources, ultimately fostering support and empowerment within the community.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    This project marks our group's first venture beyond the projects within our courses. Given the gravity of the topic addressed by our chatbot, we approached its ideation with careful consideration. Extensive research was imperative, prompting us to collaborate closely with VLMFSS to obtain firsthand insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our foremost challenge lies in crafting a chatbot that could interactively respond to users while protecting their privacy and offering appropriate assistance. Additionally, we aimed to integrate the chatbot across various social media platforms, a task hindered by time constraints and our limited coding expertise. Consequently, we opted to utilize ManyChat for the prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While our project remains ongoing, I now laid a solid foundation for future iterations. As I continue to enhance my coding skills, I'm confident in my ability to develop a custom chatbot solution capable of seamless integration with diverse social media platforms. Ultimately, our efforts culminated in success, with our project being honored as the <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/engagement-competition/past-projects/2023/one-tap-away.html">SFU Student-Community Engagement winner for 2023-2024</a>.
